When you ask most people what their favorite Mexican dish is, most will respond with classic dishes, such as tacos, burritos, carnitas, or fajitas. They’re classics for a reason: they’re delicious, and people love them!

As such, a Mexican restaurant needs to offer a strong roster of classic dishes such as these. Truthfully, if a restaurant can’t execute traditional Mexican dishes, what does that say about more creative or fusion-type options offered on the menu?

At Borracha, we have a strong roster of your favorite classic Mexican dishes. Starting on the appetizer menu, we have Guacamole (made with avocado, garlic, lime-cilantro, cotija cheese, and served with chips or veggies), Nachos (made with jalapeno cheese sauce, pico de gallo, arbol salsa, sour cream, pickled red onions, and jalapenos); we also have an entire section of the menu dedicated to tacos, both street and traditional style; burritos, enchiladas, fajitas also have their ample real estate on the menu, as well.
